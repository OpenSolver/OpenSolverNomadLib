This repository contains Visual Studio 2010 project files for compiling the NOMAD solver from source.

The project files assume that this repository is in the same root folder as the [OpenSolverNomadDll](https://github.com/OpenSolver/OpenSolverNomadDll) repository. After the build has completed, the resulting library (`libnomad.lib` or `libnomad-debug.lib`) is copied into the OpenSolverNomadDll repository to the 32 or 64 bit NOMADLib folder as appropriate.

The NOMAD optimiser is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (see the included license file) and is freely available for download at http://www.gerad.ca/NOMAD. 

Thanks to Jonathon Currie (of the [OPTI Toolbox Matlab add-in](http://www.i2c2.aut.ac.nz/Wiki/OPTI/)) for his help in setting this up.
